I bought some flowers for my mother
I bought my mother some flowers
Someone kicked the ball
There is a fly in the car with us
Are you ready
Where were you yesterday
I told you something
I sat between Tom and John
Is the mouse dead or alive
It hardly ever rains there
She was crying in her room
She married Tom last month
The rain continued all day @ It rained all day
